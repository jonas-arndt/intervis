The argumentation of <span class=\"tooltip\" ref=\"reverse-discrimination\" title=\"Refers, for example, to the argument that white people can also be exposed to racism.

Differently colored surfaces that overlap represent different social categories. Opacity marks whether a person or group is discriminated against (very high opacity) or privileged (very low opacity) based on their social category, and thus whether or not reading the underlying terms is made more difficult. This kind of representation was discarded because the layering of colored surfaces might suggest an additive connection of social categories and they are visually too separated from each other.  <br/>However, the idea of making words more difficult to read by visual means has been applied in further visualization approaches.",

The net of social categories \u2013 regardless of whether a person is discriminated against or privileged based on these social categories \u2013 can always be reconstructed for each person, and each person is shaped in an intersectional way by multiple identities. Thus, visualizing individuals or groups who experience \u00bbonly\u00ab sexist discrimination and are privileged in other social categories with exclusively horizontal strokes (indicating discrimination based on the social category of gender) is not accurate and may lead to a misunderstanding of intersectionality. This very helpful critique led to a refinement of the visual representation: the net of social categories is always visible. Discrimination is visualized by orange, foregrounded strokes.

On the one hand, because they explained and contextualized several personal experiences and feelings. On the other hand, because they explained many social phenomena and problems that I as a very privileged person did not notice before, revealed the great need for action, and created the awareness and acknowledgment that I am part of these problems and thus must take responsibility in making necessary changes.
